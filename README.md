# Socket Programming Chat Application

A simple multi-client chat application built with Python sockets demonstrating basic network programming concepts.

## Features

- Multi-client chat server
- Real-time message broadcasting
- Auto-generated usernames using Faker
- Simple command-line interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- faker library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/max-programming/socket-programming.git
cd socket-programming
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the chat server:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server will listen on `127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

### Running the Client

In separate terminal windows, start one or more clients:

```bash
uv run client.py
```

Each client will be assigned a random username and can send messages to all other connected clients.

### Chat Commands

- Type any message and press Enter to send
- Type `quit` to disconnect from the chat

## How it Works

- The server accepts multiple client connections using threading
- Each client gets a unique username generated by the Faker library
- Messages from one client are broadcast to all other connected clients
- Clients can disconnect gracefully or the server handles unexpected disconnections
